# Deforestation-Detection-Fire-Classification-Model-Week-3-AICTE
This project uses machine learning to detect and classify fire types (e.g., vegetation, offshore) using MODIS satellite data. Features like brightness, FRP, and thermal bands are analyzed using models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost, enabling accurate, automated fire detection for disaster response.

In GitHub, the ipynb file is showing only upto folium. So I have attached google drive link here in the README file.

Complete Project saved in this Google drive link.
